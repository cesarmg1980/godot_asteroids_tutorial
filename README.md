# godot_asteroids_tutorial

this is a personal project with my own version of the famous game called 'asteroids'.
it's developed following a youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsk-HSGFjnaGcjiD8y9-U_C0rB5kpDX5s) found in the channel 'KidsCanCode'..
it was developed using godot game engine.
